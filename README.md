# Intro to Vue 2 - Vue Mastery

In this course I'll develop an application that shows a product page with some interface events, like when hovering a specific button the image of the product will change and when you click in a add to cart button the total amount will increase (if the product is in stock).

This course uses the Vuejs in version 2 to teach the fundamentals of this tool. If you want to see the lessons just go to https://www.vuemastery.com.
